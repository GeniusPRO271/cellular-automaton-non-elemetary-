# 2D cellular automaton with non-elementary rules - Forest Fire

### INTRODUCTION
The forest fire model is a classic example of a cellular automaton. It is a simple yet powerful model that can demonstrate complex emergent behaviors. The model simulates the spread of fire through a forest, where trees can catch fire from neighboring trees or lightning strikes. The forest fire model can be used to study the dynamics of forest fires, as well as the impact of fire suppression policies.
### IMPLEMENTATION
To implement the forest fire model in Python, we will use the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing, and Matplotlib is a popular library for data visualization. We will use NumPy to create a 2D grid to represent the forest and Matplotlib to visualize the state of the forest at each time step.
The forest fire model consists of two main rules:
Tree Growth: At each time step, each empty cell in the grid has a probability of p_tree of becoming a tree.
Fire Spread: If a tree cell has a neighboring tree cell that is on fire or if the tree is struck by lightning (with probability f), then the tree cell catches fire and turns into a burning cell. A burning cell turns into an empty cell in the next time step.
To implement the forest fire model, we will create two functions: initialize_forest and update_forest.
The initialize_forest function creates a 2D grid of size n x n and randomly populates the grid with trees and empty cells with probability p_tree and p_burn, respectively. We will use NumPy's random.rand() function to generate random numbers between 0 and 1.
The update_forest function updates the forest according to the two main rules of the forest fire model. It creates a new 2D grid to store the updated state of the forest. For each cell in the original grid, it checks if the cell is empty, a tree, or on fire. If the cell is empty, the new grid will remain empty. If the cell is a tree, it has a probability of catching fire from a neighboring tree cell or lightning strike (with probability f). If the cell is on fire, it turns into an empty cell in the next time step.
After initializing the forest, we can simulate the forest fire for some number of time steps by repeatedly calling the update_forest function. At each time step, we can visualize the state of the forest using Matplotlib's imshow function.

### CONCLUSION
In this essay, we discussed the implementation of the forest fire model in Python using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The forest fire model is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of forest fires and the impact of fire suppression policies. By simulating the forest fire model, we can observe complex emergent behaviors and gain insights into the underlying dynamics of forest fires.
